##Feature most important
### display games as list, give downloads links. how to implement this?

Edit index info in server save as (json/yaml), pass to client, client parse it and show it.
Need define info areas (name,icon,source,link,summary)

Already have a json contains needed info.

### client app:
- construct list app
- using http request get json, parse info.
- download app icon. 
- download app/install
